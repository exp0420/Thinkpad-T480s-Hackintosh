# üìù Basic information
* Supported Mac OS versions : Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina (tweaks needed, swap out the airportlwm kext)
* Laptop runs very good but the power managment doesn't seem efficent enough (sometimes running too hot, high power usage.)
* SMBIOS: MacBookPro14,1 || MacBookPro15,2
* OpenCore Version : 0.8.7

# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
* The EFI is almost ready to go, you'll just need to generate unique SMBIOS for your device using [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS)
* Fields you'll need to modify

# ‚≠êÔ∏è Warning 
* I'm not an expert in hackintoshing, if you have any questions feel free to use the discussions tab or contact me on discord.
* Feel free to make this EFI better by contributing!  

# üíª My Hardware

These are the Hardware components I use. But this OpenCore configuation <strong>should</strong> still work with your device, even if the components are not exactly same.
